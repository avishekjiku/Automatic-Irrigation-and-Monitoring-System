# Automatic-Irrigation-and-Monitoring-System
Introduction Automatic Irrigation Process, is an automatic and self-controlled system, that can irrigate the plants properly and smartly. It works with moisture condition of the soli. And according to that, it can control the pump that will be used for irrigation. The main purpose of this system is minimizing the losses of water and power, beside of that maximize the productivity.  No doubt that, it is a must needed system for the current world. Because the main concerning issue of our modern world is decreasing the water label day by day. So proper use of water is now do or die matter for us.  The operation of this system is so simple. For irrigating of our plant, we used a dc motor means a dc pump. A sensor is joined to the soil. This sensor always measures the humidity level of the soil, and give to the CPU. CPU check the upcoming value, and according to the data, it can find either the soil is wet or dry. If the soil become wetter in a certain level it turns off the pump. And when the soil drier, the pump will be started again. All of these steps are working as a close loop system. You have to need, just install this system in your plantation and it will be irrigated automatically.Here Arduino is the heart of our system. It continuously collecting data from the sensor, and considering some condition it takes the action on the Relay and show the value in the display. Finally, Relay controlling the pump.
